<b>UPDATED: The Adafruit Sensor library includes unneccesary C code that uses Serial device, which is not always used for sensors applications. This allows for standalone usage - no extra libraries needed.</b>


# DHT sensor (Standalone edition)

## Description

An Arduino library for the DHT series of low-cost temperature/humidity sensors.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  Not only you’ll encourage the development of the library, but you’ll also learn how to best use the library and probably some C++ too

## Documentation and doxygen
Documentation is produced by doxygen. Contributions should include documentation for any new code added.
